## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Challenge result

- **05 Sep 2025**
  - ✅ Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
  - ✅ View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
  - ⚠️ See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page (basic cursor pointer added, hover/focus styles to be improved)
  - ❌ Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design with media queries
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation & event handling)
- CSS transitions for smooth animations

### What I learned

- **05 Sep 2025**
  - Learned how to use `querySelector()` not only on `document` but also on specific elements to scope DOM selection.
  - Practiced using `scrollHeight` to dynamically set `max-height` for smooth accordion transitions.
  - Implemented CSS transitions with `max-height` and `opacity` instead of `display`, which cannot be animated.
  - Understood the importance of `cursor: pointer;` and hover/focus states for better UX.
  - Used an image overlay technique (`pointer-events: none;` with opacity) to compare the implementation against the original design mockup.

### Continued development

For the next steps, I would like to focus on completing the remaining challenges:

- Implementing full **keyboard navigation** so that users can open/close questions with only the keyboard.
- Adding clear **hover and focus states** to improve accessibility and the overall user experience.

### Useful resources
